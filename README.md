# Javascript_Challenge
Creating a dynamic table and filters on a webpage using Javascript, D3.js, HTML and CSS.

In this repository, you will find two folders:

- UFO-level-1: meeting the requirements for the first part of the assignment - a dynamic table responding to one filter.
  In this folder there is the 'index.html' file and a folder called 'static'.
  You will find the javascript code in the file 'app.js' located here: UFO-level-1\static\js
  
- UFO-level-2: is the part about the bonus -  a dynamic table responding to five filters.
  This folder is organised the same way as UFO-lelve-1 with the 'index.html' page 
  and the file 'app.js' located in UFO-level-2\static\js
